This project investigates the factors influencing human weight, focusing on University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) students. The study collected data through surveys, gathering information on gender, height, sleep time, water consumption, and weight. Preliminary analysis involved creating a multiple linear regression model and checking its assumptions. While the model showed significance, it only explained 40.71% of the weight variation.

Further exploration involved examining interaction terms and refining the model using techniques like Best Subset Selection, Stepwise Regression, and Backward Deletion. Two potential models were identified, and after rigorous testing and diagnostics, Model B, incorporating gender and height as predictors, was chosen as the final model. This model, while explaining 40% of weight variability, highlights the importance of gender and height in determining a student's weight. The study suggests potential for improvement by incorporating more accurate data collection methods and additional predictor variables in future research.
